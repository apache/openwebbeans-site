# Examples

### OpenWebBeans Samples
Our samples are all in version control and can reviewed by looking at the [source][2]. 
Note that we do have a github mirror so the follow link might be convenient for you: [GitHub direct link][3].


### External Samples
CDI is a very used API and all the CDI samples you find online will easily work with OpenWebBeans. 
For web published Apache Licenced examples please have a look at the samples from [Apache TomEE][1]. They have many samples explicitly for CDI but to show of the EJB integration they use some @EJB and @Stateless in their examples. You can substitute all of these with @Inject and @ApplicationScoped respectively.
